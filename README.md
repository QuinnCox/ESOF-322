# Preface
This defines the expected readership of the document and describe its
version history, including a rationale for the creation of a new version and a
summary of the changes made in each version.

# Introduction
This describes the needs for the system. It briefly describes the
systemâ€™s functions and explain how it will work with other systems. It
also describes how the system fits into the overall business or strategic
objectives of the organization commissioning the software.

# Glossary
This defines the technical terms used in the document.

# User requirements definition
Describes the services provided for the user. The non-functional
system requirements are also described in this section. This
description uses natural language, diagrams, and other notations that are
understandable to customers. Product and process standards that must be
followed are specified.

# System architecture
This chapter presents a high-level overview of the anticipated system
architecture, showing the distribution of functions across system modules.
Architectural components that are reused are highlighted.

# System requirements specification
This describes the functional and non-functional requirements in more
detail. Further detail is also added to the non-functional
requirements.

# System models 
This includes graphical system models showing the relationships between
the system components, the system, and its environment.

# System evolution
This describes the fundamental assumptions on which the system is
based, and any anticipated changes due to hardware evolution, changing
user needs, and so on.

# Appendices
These provide detailed, specific information that is related to the
application being developed. Hardware requirements define the minimal
and optimal configurations for the system. Database requirements define 
the logical organization of the data used by the system and the
relationships between data.

# Index
Several indexes to the document are included. As well as a normal
alphabetic index, there is also an index of diagrams, an index of functions,
and so on.
