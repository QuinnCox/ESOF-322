--Introduction--

This is our system we have designed, it is needed in the restraunt/workplace to keep tasks orginized and running smoothly. It's requirments 
are catigorized by who will be using the system and where at in the process we are. 

--Basic overview of Requirements/Functions--

Server - The Server will be able to select menu items when taking orders and be able to customize them with a well made UI.
- (How does this relate and work with other systems)

Cooks - The Cooks will be able to see all of the important information relating to order tickets such as number of orders, what is in process of 
being made/delayed, number of the ticket/how many tickets, and type of order (online, in house, doordash, etc.). 
- (How does this relate and work with other systems)

Checkout - In the checkout for the customer we will be able to apply coupons/discounts to the added total of the ticket and be able to process 
all payment types.

Behind the Scenes - In the behind the scenes there is many important procceses going on. Most of it will have to do with order handling. Making sure each order
has a unique number so that they are easy to order and keep track of. The orders should also be catigorized by the station they should be sent to.

--Non-Functional Requirements--

The non-functional requirements are 

Database of times to cook
Customer gets order in a timely manner
Operating system 

This is the overview of what our software will be able to do for the buissness. This process will accelerate the workflow of the workers and the
background processes of the restraunt. A system such as this is required in the busy and fast paced food service industry.
